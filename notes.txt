Create a currency list variable, because there's no use writing out all the options twice
$valutaList = [
  "key-value" => "actual value"
  "USD" => "U.S. Dollars",
  "EUR" => "Euros",
  "AUD" => "Australian Dollars"
]
(associative array)

php loop -> 
<?php foreach ($valutaList as $key => $option) : ?>
  <option value="<?= $key?>"> <?= $option ?> </option>
<?php endforeach; ?> 

--> everything between the opening and closing foreach is put in the loop

php echo = "=" 
so '?php echo' => '?=' 

echo "<pre>";       --> shows array type data in a structured way
var_dump($_POST);
echo "</pre>";
